# Store 20 in the variable speed (hint: int speed =20)
# Store 10 in the variable time
# Multiply speed * time and store the result in the variable distance
# Display the value of the distance variable on the screen

speed = int(20)
time = int(10)

distance = speed * time

print(distance)

#Store 172.5 in the variable force     (hint: double force = 172.5)
#Store 27.5 in the variable area
#Divide force by area and store the result in the variable pressure
#Display the value of the pressure variable on the screen

force = float(172.5)
area = float(27.5)

pressure = force / area

print(pressure)

#learned that python... handles the variables types?
#explicitly added in number types to get acquainted with number types, although it seems like python does it on it's on
#I can't do a double in python?
